		<h2>Working with ordered lists</h2>
		<p> <b> First step: </b> In order to create a list of items to be followed in an order.<!--(with numbers)--> one must use the 'ol' tag.</p>
		<p> <b> How to order the items: </b> In order to order said items, one must tag the tag 'li', add the item and then close the tag. Those tags will appear in the order they were added top to bottom in the code. </p><br>
		<p><b>An example can be found below:</b></p>

    <h2> Working with unordered lists</h2>
        <p><b>First step:</b> The process for using unordered lists is pretty similar to that of using ordered lists, with the exception that one must use the 'ul' tag.</p>
        <p><b>How to order the items:</b> The process here is precisely the same as in ordered lists using the li tag.</p> <br>
        <p><b>An example can be found below:</b></p>
    <h3>List of items in an unordered manner</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>Item 1</li>
        	<li>Item 2</li>
        	<li>Item 3</li>
        	<li>Item 4</li>

        </ul>
